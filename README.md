# DataStructure_and_Algorithm
A data structure is a particular way of storing and organizing data in a computer so that it can be used effectively.
Some examples of Data Structures are arrays, Linked List, Stack, Queue, etc. 

There are two types of Data structure _
1) Primitive
2) Non-Primitive

Here,We discuss Non-primitive Data-structure 
Non-Primitve are also of two types _
1)Linear 
2)Non-Linear

Linear data structure :-


                  linear
                    |
                   / \
             static   Dynamic
               |       /   | \  
             Array   stack |  queue
                           |
                        Linked List   
                        
                        
  Non-Linear data structure:-   
  
        Non-Linear
            |
           / \
       Tree  Graph
